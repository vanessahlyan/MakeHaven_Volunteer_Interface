## Questions

1. The server would likely respond with a status code of 200 because it successfully performed the request to find a page with pictures of cats.

2. The server would likely respond with a status code of 301 because the page could not longer be found at this location and the user was redirected to a different site.

3. The server would likely respond with a status code of 401 because the request requires user authentication but the user is not logged in.

4. The server would likely respond with a status code of 500 because it is unable to render the requested service--coffee brewing--and would tell the user something's wrong.
