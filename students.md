# Comparing Students

## Questions

1.1. In this line, we access a comparison function through the pointer comp.  The comparison function compares two elements (that cannot be modified as referenced by const void pointers) and returns an integer of value 0 if the two elements referenced by the const void pointers are equivalent, <0 if the element referenced by the first const void pointer should go before the other, and >0 if vice-versa.

1.2. We need to typecast a and b to const int * because we want to obtain integer values (not void) at the given address.

1.3. See `students.c`.

1.4. See `students.py`.

1.5. See `students.js`.
