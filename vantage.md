## Questions

5.1. CSV format takes up less memory because it uses a single separator comma while JSON has more syntax characters. It is also faster to process data split by a single separator comma in CSV than to interpret JSON syntax.

5.2. JSON stores information in a hierarchical manner that is more accessible to users and easier to parse.

5.3. https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=NFLX&interval=1min&apikey=NAJXWIA8D6VN6A3K

5.4. The stock prices are displayed to the 4th decimal place. In our daily lives, prices are displayed only to the hundreth place, so the last two digits are redundant and take up unnecessary space.
