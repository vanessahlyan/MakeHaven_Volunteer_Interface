Short answers for the below suffice. Remember: if you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval), be sure to email your section leader (or assigned advisor) directly.
What have you done for your project so far?
***

     We have set up a database and written out the Python code for the volunteer credit system.

***
What have you not done for your project yet?
***

     We need to figure out how to display the chore cards and how to automatically make chores pop up according to their respective recurrence cycles.

***
What problems, if any, have you encountered?
***

     We are not sure how to manage the recurrence cycles of tasks.
We had trouble viewing the SQL database at the same time. 
We were unable to insert registration information into our SQL user table.

***
If you used it (much) this term, what did you think of CS50 Discourse (the course's Q&A forum)?
***

     Liked

***
If you used CS50 Discourse and have also used Piazza (in other courses), which do you prefer?
***

     Neutral

***
Why do you feel the way you do about CS50 Discourse and/or Piazza? (Do just make clear which tool you're complimenting or critiquing.)
***

     We like CS50 Discourse because we usually get feedback quickly.

Would you be up for helping with setup for the CS50 Fair on Thu 12/7 (the day before the Fair) and/or on Fri 12/8 morning (the hours before the Fair)? It's fun! And a good way to get to know the staff! If so, we'll follow up with you via email to figure out when you're free.
